<h2> 1. Linting & Commit</h2>
<p>When committing work to push up to github Husky will go through the process of testing all of the files which provide specs. If all files are above a certain percentage (80% currently) it will then proceed to use eslint to check for any errors within our code. If errors are found we must manually go through and correct them otherwise the commit will be complete and be ready to push up.  </p>

<h4>About The Packages Being Utilized</h4>
<hr>
<li>Husky allows you to run commands prior to committing your work, thus making it extremely useful when needing to run checks or other commands such as testing before completing a commit.</li>
<li>eslint is used to help analyze your code in order to find any problems which might've been left in the current commit.</li>
</ul>
