Localstack:

Localstack has some requirements to setup the tools to use it. 
1. Python
2. Pip
3. Docker

Installation:
Localstack itself is a tool which has to be installed on local environment. (Easiest way)
- pip install localstack (Do not use root user)

Once above step is successed, Let's verify the installation.
- localstack --version

(Note that on MacOS you may have to run TMPDIR=/private$TMPDIR localstack start --docker if $TMPDIR contains a symbolic link that cannot be mounted by Docker.)


Docker Compose: Easy way to manage the docker part with Localstack.
- We have created the docker-compose.yml file in our project directory
- Hit the "docker-compose up" command on same directory
- By executing the above step, All required services (mentioned in docker-compose.yml file) get started automatically

Now, Localstack environment is ready to use. Please find below services to use their respective ports.
- S3:	http://localhost:4572
- Cloudformation:	http://localhost:4581
- Lambda:	http://localhost:4574
- IAM:	http://localhost:4593
- API Gateway:	http://localhost:4567
- EC2:	http://localhost:4597
- Cloudwatch:	http://localhost:4582


There is one more point needs to be consider for making easier handy command on AWS CLI for localstack. It is called as "AWS Local CLI".

It is a thin CLI wrapper that runs commands directly against LocalStack. If we do not install Localstack AWS CLI, then we have to mentione "--endppoint-url" argiment to all AWS CLI command.

Please follow instruction to install it AWS Local CLI
- pip install awscli-local

It will enable the commands starting with "awslocal". 


There are some basic commands, I'm mentioning here for our reference.

Create Lambda Role: (To execute the lmambda function)
- awslocal iam create-role --role-name lambda-ex --assume-role-policy-document file://role.json

Listing the IAM Roles
- awslocal iam list-roles

Attaching the policies to the created/existing IAM role: (To give the access on lambda function)
- awslocal iam attach-role-policy --role-name lambda-ex --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole

View the attached the policy of individual IAM role:
- awslocal iam list-role-policies --role-name lambda-ex


Create Lambda Function: Python: 
- awslocal lambda create-function --function-name my-function --zip-file fileb://HelloWorld.zip --handler 'HelloWorld.lambda_handler' --runtime python2.7 --role arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/lambda-ex

Invoke Lambda Function:
- awslocal lambda invoke --function-name my-function out --log-type Tail
